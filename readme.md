# Node.js Random Color Generator

> return a random color in the command line.

enter a specific command in the command line to generate a block of approximately 31x9 # characters in a random color, and display the random color's name in the middle (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000)

It also accepts the request for a:

- hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
- luminosity (e.g. light or dark)

...and then generates random colors that match those choices.
